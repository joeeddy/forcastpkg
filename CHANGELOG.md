## [0.1.0] - 2024-08-11

### Added - Complete Package Refactoring

This release represents a complete transformation of the WebscraperApp into a focused, pip-installable forecasting package called `forcasting_pkg`.

#### Core Package Structure
- **Main Package**: `forcasting_pkg` with modular architecture
- **Forecasting Module**: Multiple forecasting algorithms with unified interface
- **Analysis Module**: Comprehensive technical analysis toolkit
- **Data Module**: Multi-source data management with fallback mechanisms
- **Visualization Module**: Matplotlib and Plotly integration for plotting
- **CLI Module**: Command-line interface for all functionality
- **Models Module**: Pydantic data models for type safety

#### Forecasting Capabilities
- **ARIMA Forecasting**: Auto-parameter selection with statsmodels integration
- **Linear Regression**: Polynomial regression with trend decomposition
- **Moving Average Models**: Simple, Exponential, and Adaptive implementations
- **Ensemble Methods**: Model combination with weighted averaging
- **Custom Model Support**: Plugin architecture for user-defined models

#### Technical Analysis
- **Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Williams %R, CCI
- **Signal Generation**: Automated buy/sell/hold signals with confidence levels
- **Multi-Indicator Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis with recommendations
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configurable periods and thresholds

#### Data Management
- **Multi-Source Support**: Yahoo Finance with mock data fallback
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic models ensuring data integrity
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints throughout the codebase
- **Flexible Configuration**: Configurable data source priorities

#### Developer Experience
- **CLI Tools**: Complete command-line interface (`forcasting-cli`)
- **Examples**: Basic and advanced usage examples with real scenarios
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with fixtures and edge cases
- **Documentation**: Detailed README with API reference
- **Jupyter Integration**: Tutorial notebook with interactive examples

#### Package Infrastructure
- **pip Installation**: Modern setup with optional dependencies
- **Entry Points**: Console scripts for CLI functionality
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system via `ForecastingConfig`
- **Export/Import**: JSON serialization for forecast results
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for models and data sources

### Changed - Major Architectural Changes

#### From Web API to Python Package
- Removed FastAPI web framework dependencies
- Removed authentication and web-specific middleware
- Transformed REST endpoints into direct Python API
- Eliminated uvicorn server and async web handling

#### From App-Specific to General-Purpose
- Removed news scraping functionality (Google News, Reddit)
- Removed weather data integration (Open-Meteo API)
- Removed web scraping components (BeautifulSoup, feedparser)
- Focused purely on financial forecasting and technical analysis

#### From Monolithic to Modular
- Split large service files into focused modules
- Created clear separation between forecasting, analysis, data, and visualization
- Implemented plugin architecture for extensibility
- Established clear API boundaries between modules

### Removed - Legacy Components

#### Web Application Components
- FastAPI application (`app/main.py`)
- API routers (`app/api/`)
- Authentication middleware (`app/auth.py`)
- Web-specific error handling and validation

#### Non-Forecasting Services
- News aggregation services (`app/services/news.py`)
- Weather data services (`app/services/weather.py`)
- Reddit and RSS feed parsing
- Social media sentiment analysis

#### Development and Deployment
- Docker configuration for web deployment
- Gunicorn and uvicorn server configurations
- Environment-based authentication tokens
- Web-specific rate limiting and CORS

### Enhanced - Improved Functionality

#### Forecasting Accuracy
- Enhanced ARIMA implementation with auto-parameter selection
- Improved confidence interval calculations
- Better handling of insufficient data scenarios
- More robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Technical Analysis
- Expanded indicator set with additional oscillators
- Improved signal generation with multi-indicator consensus
- Better trend detection and strength measurement
- Enhanced recommendation system

#### Data Quality
- Improved OHLC data validation
- Better handling of missing data points
- More robust date parsing and timezone handling
- Enhanced data source failover mechanisms

#### User Experience
- Comprehensive CLI with intuitive commands
- Better error messages and debugging information
- Extensive examples covering common use cases
- Interactive Jupyter notebook tutorial

## Migration Guide

### For Users of the Original WebscraperApp

If you were using the original WebscraperApp for forecasting functionality, here's how to migrate:

#### Installation
```bash
# Old: Clone and run FastAPI server
git clone <repo> && cd WebscraperApp && uvicorn app.main:app

# New: Install as pip package
pip install forcasting-pkg
```

#### Forecasting
```python
# Old: HTTP API calls
import httpx
response = await client.get("/api/analysis/forecast/AAPL?model_type=arima")

# New: Direct Python API
from forcasting_pkg import ForecastingEngine
engine = ForecastingEngine()
forecast = engine.forecast(data, "arima", "AAPL")
```

#### Technical Analysis
```python
# Old: HTTP API calls
response = await client.get("/api/analysis/technical-indicators/AAPL")

# New: Direct Python API
from forcasting_pkg import TechnicalAnalyzer
analyzer = TechnicalAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze(data, "AAPL")
```

#### Data Access
```python
# Old: Service layer with external dependencies
from app.services.market_data import MarketDataService
service = MarketDataService()
data = await service.get_historical_data("AAPL", 90)

# New: Simple data source interface
from forcasting_pkg.data import get_historical_data
data = get_historical_data("AAPL", 90)
```

### Deprecated Features

The following features from the original WebscraperApp are no longer available:

- News aggregation and sentiment analysis
- Weather data integration
- Reddit and social media scraping
- Web-based dashboard and API endpoints
- Authentication and user management
- Rate limiting and CORS handling

### Future Plans

- Additional forecasting models (Prophet, Neural Networks)
- Real-time data streaming support
- Portfolio optimization algorithms
- Advanced backtesting framework
- Web dashboard as optional add-on package
- Integration with more data providers
